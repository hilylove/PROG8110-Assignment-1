I upgraded this from assignment 2 by allowing data to store in the firebase and I also added an admin page so the orders can be showed there.

You can display the order details as you wish by changing the code in `orders.js`

To run:

1. Sign up for paypal developer sandbox and get a client id
2. The first time run `npm install`
3. `SB_CLIENT_ID=<put_in_your_client_id> npm start`
4. Add your firebase Config in the `firebase.js`
